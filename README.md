# About the Dataset

The dataset is created by Udit Kumar Chatterjee and is obtained from [data.world](https://data.world/dataman-udit/us-regional-sales-data). It consists of 6 tables, namely-
1. sales_orders_sheet
2. customers_sheet
3. store_locations_sheet
4. products_sheet
5. regions_sheet
6. sales_team_sheet

### Reliability and Originality:
There is no information how the data is collected or preprocessed. Since this dataset has been provided by Coursera in this capstone project we can assume its reliability and originality.

### Comprehensiveness:
The data contains information that may help us find the answer to the key question **What’s likely to make the employee leave the company?**. But there are many more reasons for an employee to leave a company. For example, personal reasons (relocating for a spouce, family or health issues), work-life balance, incompatility between employer and employee, lack of opportunity, financial reasons etc. 

### Citation:
There is no external citation for this dataset. One can visit [data.world](https://data.world/dataman-udit/us-regional-sales-data) for basic informations.

### Current:
The dataset was created 3 years ago. Clearly it is outdated.
